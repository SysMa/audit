@node Kerberos, , Bookmarks, top
@chapter Kerberos

If Yafc is compiled with Kerberos, it tries to authenticate using Kerberos 4/5
without sending the password in cleartext. For anonymous logins, Kerberos
is never used. The default protection level for data connections is
clear, ie no encryption on transfers. Use the command @code{prot}
(@ref{prot}), to change the data protection level. Valid arguments are
@code{clear}, @code{safe}, and @code{private}. Note that confidential
protection is not supported in Kerberos 4. You can use the @samp{prot} keyword
(@pxref{Bookmark keywords}) in the bookmarks file to automagically set the
protection level for a specific host.
